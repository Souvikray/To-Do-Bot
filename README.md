This application is basically a bot that stores a list of to-do tasks and presents it to us when demanded.So we can use this bot to store regular to-do tasks from our daily lives and compelete them one by one and ask the bot to delete them as we complete each task.At any time we can add a new task to the list and view the tasks that needs to be done.

We start off the conversation with a '/start' command which is a Telegram command.

We type out the task that needs to be completed and the bot stores.

At anytime we can type '/done' command which displays a keyboard containing pending tasks and we can tap on one or more items to delete them.

Alternatively we can type in the task again and the bot will delete it from the list but the former (/done) is preferred.
